Objective :
	This project introduces an Innovative Voice Billing System utilizing HTML, CSS, and Python to modernize the billing process. By integrating voice recognition technology, users can interact with the system through voice commands. The front-end, designed with HTML and CSS, offers a user-friendly interface for inputting and 
reviewing billing information. Python handles voice recognition, data processing, and server communication on the back-end, converting spoken words into text and 
generating accurate bills. This approach simplifies billing, enhances accessibility for a wider audience, including those with disabilities, and demonstrates the 
potential of combining web technologies with voice recognition for efficient billing solutions.

Technologies Used:
	Front end: HTML, CSS
	Back end: Python(flask)
